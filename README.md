# customer-segmentation-churn-analysis
Data Science project using Python for customer segmentation with K-Means clustering and churn prediction using classification models. Includes EDA, ML modeling, and business insights for customer retention.

# üìä Customer Segmentation & Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior to uncover patterns that drive retention and churn. Using data-driven insights, we segment customers into distinct groups and build predictive models to identify those at high risk of leaving.

## üìù Summary

In this project, we:
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand customer behavior and key churn indicators.
- Applied **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on features like purchase frequency, engagement, and spending.
- Built **classification models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict churn likelihood.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.
- Provided **business insights** and **recommendations** for reducing churn and targeting the right customer segments.

This end-to-end analysis enables businesses to take data-driven actions to **boost customer retention** and **maximize lifetime value**.
